1. Caesar Cipher: Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
2. Substrings: Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
